# Image Generation & Computer Vision Models play a game of Telestrations

Get text-to-image and image-to-text AI models into an infinite loop, feeding the output of one as the input of the other, thus playing an endless game of Telestrations where the first model illustrates the description of the second, while the second model describes what the first drew.

Requirements:
- an [OpenAI API account](https://platform.openai.com/account/organization) & API key,
- a [RunPod.io API account](https://www.runpod.io/console/signup) & API key,
- any computer vision model, like LLaVa and BakLLaVa, running locally via [Ollama](https://ollama.ai).

## Getting started

1. Setup and start the UI with the following commands:
```
npm install
echo '{ "OPENAI": "<YOUR API KEY HERE>", "RUNPOD": ""<YOUR API KEY HERE>" }' > api-keys.json
npm start
```
2. Visit http://localhost:8000/ with your browser
3. Enter a short description in the image prompt
4. Click the "Send" icon
5. Adjust the other prompts or model selection as needed
